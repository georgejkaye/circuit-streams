(* Assign values to each states 

   We can't use 'pure' one-hot encodings since we need to preserve monotonicity. 
   However (thanks to David Sprunger) there is a way, as long as V is a power of 2.

   Say we have states {s0, s1, s2, s3} and the order

                s3
              /   \
            s1    s2
              \  /
               s0

   Then we can encode these in a way compatible with monotonicity by assigning them
   each a bitstring of 4 bits, where b_k is 1 if s >= s_k and 0 otherwise.
